# reader-view
Mozilla's reader view as a web service

The concept here is to be able to go to allow you to the reader view of any
web page by just requesting a web page through this service.

Current usage is making a requst to `/<your_webpage_url>` and it will return 
the reader view html of the `your_webpage_url`
